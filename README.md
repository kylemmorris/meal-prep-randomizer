# Meal Prep Randomizer

This is a small project I made in about 30 minutes that will take, as input, a *.mpr file filled with your options for what you would like to "meal prep" for the week.
When ran, it will randomize each set of options and give you a sample meal prep you can try.

If you have VSCode, you can open this workspace in there and try building. Just uses g++, and only contains a small amount of files.
